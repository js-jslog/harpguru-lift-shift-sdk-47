# HarpGuruExpoBoilerplate

This project is simply some expo boilerplate set up to run the HarpGuru application.

# Split from HarpNative

This project was imported in to this monorepo from a previous isolated project called HarpNative. This project was a combination of both the react native application code and the expo boilerplate. At the time of the split, the version was returned to 0.1.0. As you'll be able to tell from the other packages split apart in thie monorepo since then, I now think that this is a mistake; but you live and learn.
