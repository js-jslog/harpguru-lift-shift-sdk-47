# HarpCovariance

A library for modeling the covarying relationship between the `Degree`, `Pitch` and `Pozition` concepts on a harmonica.

# Split from harpstrata and harpguru-core

This package was created as a fragmentation of functionality from the harpstrata package and includes an unexposed `getCovarianceSeries` function which was packaged up as an unused export the harpguru-core package.
